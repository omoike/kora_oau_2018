#### Getting started
After completing the initial team/participant registration with the organizers, each team lead (or individual) should proceed with the following setup steps:
1. Join the Slack group created for the purpose of this hackathon https://join.slack.com/t/korahackathon/shared_invite/enQtNDA1MzU2NzIwNzM2LWMyZWFiZTc1MWQxYmY1MGI1ZWQ1ZmFiMTg1YWE2MmQ2OTk3NWNhODcyMGUyNTA3NGUyNmIxYWYzNWY0OWM3NDQ

1. Create your own `Fork` of the Submission Repo (https://github.com/korahackathon/kora_oau_2018/) to your team lead's github account. To do this, the team lead should simply click the 'fork' button in the top right (On the Submission Repo).
1. You should update the `team_info.md` file on your own fork repo with information of you team and the solution you are building as outlined for you there.
1. On your own fork, create a team branch in the format `team_<your team name>` (note it is underscore-seprated). For example, if you name your team "Bad Like That", then the team branch you will create would be `team_bad_like_that`.
1. Add your team members to your forked repo and proceed to build your solution by on that your fork. Note that eventually, all code should be merged back into team branch you created as that's the only branch that will be submitted and reviewed.
1. Note that during the course of the hackathon, the judges might be checking in your repos and also on-site to get friendly feelers about what your doing and how it's going. It's no biggie, we just wanna say hi ;)

Still not sure how to do this? Please reach out to any of the organizers on the Slack channel.

#### Submission
To submit your solution for review:
1. Go to the Submission Repo (https://github.com/korahackathon/kora_oau_2018/) and confirm that a branch named exactly as the team branch your created on your own fork exists there (It should have been created automatically for you by the judges). If it hasn't, send a message on the Slack channel to them and it will be done for you.
1. On your own team's forked repo, click on the `New Pull Request` button. On the *Comparing changes* page that shows after, confirm that:
  -  `base fork:` is set to `korahackathon/kora_oau_2018`.
  -  `base:` branch is set to your team branch on the submission repo.
  -  `head fork:` is set to your team's forked repo where you build your solution.
  -  `compare:` is set to you team branch on your forked repo.
For example, if your team is "Team Elvis" and your team branch is named `team_elvis` then it would be something like:

1. Click on the `Create pull request` button to submit it. The judges will take up review from there.
